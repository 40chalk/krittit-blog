  'I am a multi lingual dev as I imagine most devs are these day. I work with primarily PHP and JavaScript along with most of their big frameworks and libraries. I also dabble in Java and Python as well. Making the occasional MineCraft mod or mod-pack. This is a collection of project showcases, thoughts related to dev, and problems that I have encountered where I thought the solutions might be helpful to others.'
